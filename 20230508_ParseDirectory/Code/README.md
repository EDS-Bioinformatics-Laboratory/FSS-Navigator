* **Navigate.py**. The Python program
* **Test_Navigate_Module.py**. Python program to test if Navigate.py can be imported and executed as a module. Note: this works from command line but for unknown reason not from within DataSpell.
* **0_GETTINGSTARTED.docx.**  This template document should describe the most important aspects of your project to introduce it to your peers. This file should be in the root of the FSS and manually converted to an html file. Alternatively, you can use any other document type (e.g., LaTex).
* **Navigation.conf**.  Configuration file that determines the content of Navigation.html. This file should be in the root of the FSS.
* **navigate-template.html**. (template that will be copied to Navigation.html). This file should be present in the directory .navigate
