# Directory: Results

Description:

This directory should contain the results from a specific data analysis.



Impose a clear structure on this directory. For example: 

* **Tables**
  
  * CSV or Tab delimited files used to generate results tables or figures
  * e.g., Analysis_script.R --> Tables --> Figure_script.R --> Figures
* **Figures**
  
  * Format: jpg, tiff, png etc
* **Intermediate results**

  

Note: for the 'important' figures (e.g., for a manuscript) the underlying data table should be separately available. In addition, the code to make the figure should be stand-alone such that figures can easily be reproduced, changed, or analyzed.
